I have two files which is functional.js for functional programming code example and object.js for object oriented programming code example.

The example of my code in functional.js file show how we can get different types of coffee depending on the number people. We have the function representing the types of coffee and number of cups needed, so the example will return an array of string representing a cup of each type of coffee. To run this code open the terminal and type node the name of the file followed by enter key then you will get the output result.

For object.js file the example is for creating a subclass, the idea here is to create a Bmw class, Instead of creating the class from scratch - stating the name and color afresh, we will inherit those properties from the parent cars class. This cars class can then have extra properties like modelYear.We need a parent which the subclass inherits from. The volvo inherit properties from Bmw. To run this code open the terminal and then type node name of the file followed by the enter key then you will get the output result.
